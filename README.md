# TuringHaskell
A basic turing machine written in haskell, allong with a program that doubles a tally of ones ("111" -> "111111")
To compile install the GHC toolchain (if you haven't already) from https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/
Then to download and run the project, type in your unix terminal of choice:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luke-A-C-Roberts/TuringHaskell
cd TuringHaskell/turing
ghc turing_haskell.hs
./turing_haskell
```
